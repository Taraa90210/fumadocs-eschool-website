# Leave Management

The **Leave Management** feature in the eSchool platform enables students, faculty, or staff to formally submit leave of absence (permit) requests for various reasons such as illness, family matters, or other urgent necessities. Submissions are processed directly through the system and undergo administrative verification for official recording.
