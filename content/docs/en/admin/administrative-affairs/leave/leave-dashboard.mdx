The **Leave Dashboard** page is used to monitor overall staff leave data, displaying real-time statistics, and providing a brief summary in table and graph form.

***

### Purpose

Makes it easier for the school admin or HR to:

* View the total number of leave requests submitted/processed.
* Monitor the total number of staff.
* View the list of latest leave requests.
* Analyze the distribution of leave status (approved, rejected, pending).
* View the recap of leave requests for the current week.

***

### Elements on the Dashboard Page

#### 1. **Brief Statistics**

At the top of the page, there are two information boxes:

* **Total Leave** → total number of leave requests recorded in the system.
* **Total Staff** → total number of staff registered in the system.

***

#### 2. **Leave List Table**

Displays the list of leave requests in a table format, containing:

* **Name** → the name of the staff who applied for leave.
* **Date** → start date to end date of leave.
* Data is displayed per page with a `pagination` navigation option.

***

#### 3. **Pie Chart - Leave Status (Today)**

Displays the percentage of leave request status for today:

* **Pending** (dark red color)
* **Approved** (medium red color)
* **Rejected** (light red color)

This graph helps to view the composition of leave status quickly.

***

#### 4. **Bar Chart - Recap This Week**

The bar chart displays the number of leave requests **approved** for each day in the current week.

* X-axis → day (Monday–Friday)
* Y-axis → number of approved leave requests

***

### Usage Tips

* Use the leave list table to see detail on who is currently on leave.
* Check the pie chart to understand the distribution of leave status on a specific day.
* Use the weekly graph to predict staff replacement needs when many are on leave.

***

### Technical Notes

* Data is updated in real-time according to leave input/approval in the leave request module.
* Changes in leave status directly affect the graphs and tables.
* Pagination is used to limit the amount of data per page to remain fast and accessible.
