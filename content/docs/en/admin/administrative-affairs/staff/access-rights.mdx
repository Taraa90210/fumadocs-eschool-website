The **Access Rights** page is used to manage the roles and permissions held by users within the **E-SCHOOL SIAKAD Plus** system. Through this feature, administrators can create new roles, change existing roles, review access right details, and delete roles permanently.

***

### **Purpose**

This feature aims to:

* Regulate the access rights of each user role as needed.
* Determine permissions for specific modules or functions within the system.
* Maintain security and data access order.

***

### **Access Rights List View**

The **Access Rights** table displays a list of registered roles, including:

* **Number** sequence.
* **Name** of the role.
* **Action** (vertical three dots icon **⋮**).

***

### **Action Menu**

Click the **⋮** icon in the **Action** column to display three options:

1. **View** → Displays the list of permissions held by that role.
   * The page will move to **View Access Rights** as in the third image.
   * This mode is only *read-only* and editing cannot be performed.
2. **Edit** → Change the role name and the list of permissions it holds.
   * The page will move to **Edit Access Rights** as in the fourth image.
   * Administrators can enable or disable permissions as needed.
3. **Delete Permanently** → Deletes the role along with all its permission settings from the system.

***

### **Creating a New Role**

2. The page will move to **Create New Role** as in the second image.
3. Complete:
   * **Name** of the role (mandatory).
   * Desired **Permission** choices (can select one by one or use the *Select All* button).
4. Click **Save** to save the new role.

***

### **Important Notes**

* Ensure that each role is only given permissions according to its responsibilities to maintain data security.
* Use the **View** option to verify access rights without the risk of data changes.
* The **Delete Permanently** option is final; deleted data cannot be recovered.
* Creating a new role will immediately add it to the list of roles that can be used when adding or changing user data.
