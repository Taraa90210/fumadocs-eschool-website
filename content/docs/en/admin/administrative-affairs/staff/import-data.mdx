The **Import Staff Data** page is used to add employee or staff data in bulk to the **E-SCHOOL SIAKAD Plus** system through uploading a file in **.CSV** format. This feature simplifies the process for administrators to input a lot of staff data at once, without having to add them one by one manually.

***

### **Purpose**

This feature aims to:

* Speed up the staff data input process.
* Minimize manual input errors.
* Provide a standard format for data consistency.

1. **Select Role**\
   Select the appropriate staff role in the *Role* column. This role will apply to all imported staff data.
2. **Download Sample File**\
   Click the **Sample File** button to download the CSV file containing the standard format that must be followed.\
   The column structure in the sample file is:

* `first_name` → First name
* `last_name` → Last name
* `mobile` → Phone number
* `email` → Email address
* `dob` → Date of birth (format: DD-MM-YYYY)
* `salary` → Base salary

   Complete the CSV file with staff data according to the format. Ensure that no columns are deleted or renamed.
2. **Upload File**

   * Ensure the file type is **.CSV**.
3. **Save Data**\
   Once the file is uploaded, click **Save** to process and add the data to the system.

### **Important Notes**

* The date format must follow **DD-MM-YYYY** so that the data is correctly read by the system.
* Ensure the email address is valid to avoid failure in sending information to the staff.
* Re-check the data before uploading to minimize errors.
* The system only accepts files with the **.CSV** extension.
