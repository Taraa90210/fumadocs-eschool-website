The **Staff Management** page is used to manage employee or staff data registered within the **E-SCHOOL SIAKAD Plus** system. Administrators can add new staff, update existing staff information, deactivate staff (soft delete), and manage salary, allowance, and deduction information.

***

### **Purpose**

This feature aims to:

* Simplify the process of recording and updating staff data.
* Provide centralized and structured personnel information.
* Manage staff activity status.
* Manage salary details in an integrated manner.

***

### **Adding New Staff**

1. Fill in the **Add Staff** form with the following details:
   * **Role** (mandatory)
   * **Full Name** (mandatory)
   * **Nickname** (optional)
   * **Phone Number** (optional)
   * **Email** (optional)
   * **Date of Birth** (optional)
   * **Salary** (mandatory in numeric format)
   * **Profile Picture** (optional, JPG/PNG/SVG format, size 308×338 pixels)
   * **Status** → *Active* or *Inactive*
2. If necessary, add **Allowances** or **Deductions** by selecting the **+ New Allowance** or **+ New Deduction** button.
3. Click **Save** to add the staff data.

### **Staff List**

The **Staff List** table displays registered staff information, including:

Status filters for **Active** or **Inactive** are available to facilitate data search.

### **Action Menu**

Click the **⋮** icon in the **Action** column to display three options:

1. **Edit** → Update staff data such as role, name, contact, salary, photo, and *reset password* option.\
   When choosing this option, a **modal window** will appear as shown in the second image.
2. **Salary Information** → Manage staff salary, allowance, and deduction details.\
   This option will redirect to the **Salary Information** page as shown in the third image.
3. **Deactivate** → Deactivate staff without permanent deletion from the system (*soft delete*). Deactivated staff data can still be accessed through the **Inactive** filter.

On the **Salary Information** page, administrators can:

* Add types of **Allowances** along with their amounts.
* Add types of **Deductions** along with their amounts or percentages.
* View the recap:
  * **Base Salary**
  * **Total Allowances**
  * **Total Deductions**
  * **Net Salary** (automatically calculated by the system)
* Delete allowance or deduction entries with the **❌** icon.
* Save changes by clicking the **Save** button.

### **Important Notes**

* Use the **Active/Inactive** filter to separate staff who are currently active and those who are no longer active.
* Ensure the input salary data is correct before saving.
* The *Deactivate* feature is used to stop a staff member's active status without deleting their historical data.
* Changes to salary data will directly affect the calculation of the staff's net salary.
