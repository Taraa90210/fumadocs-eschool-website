This page is used to manage class data at the school in a flexible and structured manner.

The Add Class page in E-SCHOOL Siakad Plus makes it easy for admins to create, edit, or delete class data according to level, major, shift, and study group. This feature allows accurate class management and can be updated easily at any time.
