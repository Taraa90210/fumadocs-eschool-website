With this feature, school management can understand the distribution of subjects, majors, classes, and study groups quickly and accurately.

### Main Statistical Summary

At the top of the dashboard, users are immediately presented with important numbers, for example:

* **Total Classes**: 36 active classes recorded.
* **Total Majors**: 4 majors available.
* **Number of Subjects**: 56 subjects registered in the system.

These statistics provide a macro view of the scope of the curriculum currently running at the school.

### Academic Visualization

#### Class Levels

* Displayed in the form of a **pie chart** that divides classes, for example:
  * X
  * XI
  * XII
* Each has a **proportional distribution (33.3%)**, showing the balance of the number of classes at each level.

#### Subject Categories

* Displayed in the form of a **donut chart**.
* All registered subjects fall into the **Theory (100%)** category — an indicator that the curriculum structure is more theory-based, and allows schools to consider adding practical subjects if needed.

#### Study Groups

* Bar chart displays the distribution of study groups based on combinations of **level and major**, such as:
  * X TKJ, X RPL, XI ELIN, XII METRO, and others.
* This visual is very helpful for knowing the density of study groups directly and arranging the distribution of lesson hours or teachers.
