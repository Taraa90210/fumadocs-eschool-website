### Exam Status Labels Modal Display

After selecting Status Labels, the system will display a modal containing exam implementation status details with the following information:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **No** | Sequence number of registered exam schedule. |
| **Subject** | Name of the subject being tested. |
| **Date** | Date of exam implementation. |
| **Start Time** | Time when the exam begins. |
| **End Time** | Time when the exam ends. |
| **Subject Teacher** | Name of the teacher in charge of the relevant subject. |
| **Status** | Shows whether the exam has **Completed** or is still in process. |

**Note**: This status is informative and cannot be changed manually through this modal. The system will automatically mark the exam as "Completed" if the schedule has passed the established implementation time.
