This page is used to manage the list of study groups for each grade level and major.

The **Study Groups** page in eSchool SIAKAD Plus functions to manage data on the division of study groups within each level or major available at the school. This feature is essential as a foundation for scheduling, teacher assignments, and other academic administration.

- **Add Study Group Form** (left)
- **Study Group Registry** (right)

---

### Adding a Study Group

To add a new study group, you only need to:

1. Enter the **Name** of the study group (example: A, B, C, etc.).
2. Click the **Save** button.

Successfully added data will immediately appear in the table on the right.

### Managing the Study Group Registry

In the **Study Group Registry** section, all registered groups are displayed, complete with sequence numbers and group names.

In the **Actions** column, you will see a vertical three-dot icon (⋮). Click this icon to open two options:

- **Edit**: To change the name of an existing study group.
- **Delete**: To remove study group data.

Here's the display when the action button is clicked:

### Edit Study Group

If you select **Edit**, a modal form will appear as follows:

In this form, you can change the **Name** of the study group, then click **Save** to save the changes.

---

### Delete Study Group

If you select the **Delete** option, the relevant study group data will be immediately removed from the system. Make sure you confirm first, as this process cannot be undone.

---

### Notes

- Ensure study group names are not duplicated to avoid conflicts in academic data.
- Study groups that have been used in other configurations (e.g., scheduling) should not be deleted without adjusting other data.
