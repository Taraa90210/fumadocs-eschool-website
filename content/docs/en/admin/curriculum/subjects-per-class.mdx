This page is used to manage subjects assigned to each class easily and systematically.


The **Subjects per Class** page in eSchool Siakad Plus is used to determine, modify, and monitor the list of subjects applicable to each class, complete with the division of core subjects and elective subjects. This data becomes the main reference in schedule settings, assignments, and exams.
