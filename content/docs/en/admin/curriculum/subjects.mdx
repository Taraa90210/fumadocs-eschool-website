This page is used to add and manage school subject data centrally.

The **Subjects** page in eSchool Siakad Plus is used to create, update, and delete the list of subjects used in the school system. Each subject is uniquely arranged based on **name, code, type** (theory/practical), **instructional language**, **identity color**, and **representative image**. This data is used as a basis in class settings, schedules, teachers, and exams.
