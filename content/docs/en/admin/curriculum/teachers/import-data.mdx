2. Click the **Sample File** button to download the CSV template.
3. Fill in the file according to the given format.

### Required CSV File Format

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only files with `.csv` (Comma Separated Values) extension can be used for the import process.

The uploaded file must meet the predetermined structure, cannot be in Excel (`.xlsx`), `.ods`, or other formats.
