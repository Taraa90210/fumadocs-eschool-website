### Automatic Calculation Results

After all data is entered, the system will automatically calculate:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Basic Salary** | Main salary received by teacher. |
| **Allowances** | Total of all salary additions. |
| **Deductions** | Total deductions based on percentage or fixed amount. |
| **Net Salary** | Final salary received by teacher after deductions and added allowances. |

**Example:**
- Basic Salary: 55
- Allowances: 20,000
- Deductions: 10% of 55 = 5.5
- **Net Salary** = 55 + 20,000 - 5.5 = **20,049.5**

### Usage Tips

- Valid salary data will facilitate the recording and disbursement of honorariums.
- Make sure all numbers are filled in correctly, and allowances/deductions do not overlap.
- Click **Save** after finishing inputting or updating data.
