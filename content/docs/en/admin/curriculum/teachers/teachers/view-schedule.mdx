### Schedule Display

The schedule display will be arranged based on days (Monday to Sunday) at the top and lesson hours on the left side.

Each schedule block contains information:
- **Teaching Time** (example: 07:15 – 08:40)
- **Subject** (example: MPP KWU, SKI-E)
- **Class taught** (example: XI RPL A, XI ELIN B)

Different block colors differentiate between subjects or levels.

### Benefits of This Feature

- Suitable for monitoring needs by vice principal of curriculum, admin staff, or counseling teachers.

### Usage Tips

- Use this feature before assigning additional teachers to avoid schedule conflicts.
- If there is an empty schedule on a certain day, it means the teacher has no teaching hours on that day.
- This data is pulled from the school's main schedule system, so make sure the data in the **Class Schedule** module is accurate.
