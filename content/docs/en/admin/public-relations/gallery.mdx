The Gallery feature functions to store school activity documentation in the form of images and videos (YouTube links), accompanied by descriptions and grouping based on the academic year.

***

### Purpose

Display school activity documentation collections neatly and structured so they can be accessed by the public and internal school.

***

### Menu Access

Enter the **Gallery** page from the admin sidebar. There are two main sections:

* **Add Gallery Form** (for content input)
* **Gallery List** (to view, edit, and delete entries)

***

### Adding a New Gallery

1. Fill in the Add Gallery form at the top of the page:
   * **Title**: Required (activity name).
   * **Thumbnail Image**: Required to upload, will be used as a thumbnail.
   * **YouTube Link** *(optional)*: Can add more than one with comma or enter.
   * **Description**: Activity explanation.
   * **Images**: Upload activity documentation images (can be multiple).
   * **Academic Year**: Select the academic year when the activity took place.
2. Click the `Save` button.

> Supported image formats are `jpg`, `svg`, `jpeg`, and `png`.

***

### Editing Gallery

5. Change the required data.
6. Click `Save` to save changes.

***

### Deleting Gallery

1. Find the gallery entry in the Gallery List table.
2. Click the **Action icon (⋮)**.
3. Select the **Delete** option.

> Deletion is permanent.

### Gallery List View

<img src="/images/daftar-galeri.png" alt="Image description" />

* `Academic Year` dropdown above the table to filter galleries by period.
* Search column (`Search`) in the top right.
* `↻` icon to refresh, and `⬇️` icon to export.

***

### Usage Tips

* Use short and clear activity names.
* Avoid uploading images that are too large.
* Separate YouTube links with commas if more than one.
* Choose a small image that visually represents the activity.

***

### Technical Notes

* YouTube links will not automatically be displayed as embedded videos in the list, but are stored as supplementary data.
* The system does not provide a direct image preview, only thumbnails in the table.
* Galleries are categorized by academic year, ensure the year is selected correctly.
