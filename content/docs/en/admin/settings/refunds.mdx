The **Refunds** menu serves to manage and display official school policies regarding the process of returning a sum of money to the entitled party, both students and parents/guardians, under certain conditions. This feature allows the school to convey information clearly, transparently, and in a documented manner so that all parties understand the applicable procedures.

#### **Purpose of the Refunds Menu**

* Provide written guidance on conditions that allow for refunds.
* Maintain the trust and reputation of the educational institution.
* Ensure procedures comply with applicable school regulations and policies.

#### **Main Functions**
