- **Attendance Writing Format**: Enter absence data with a specific code format:

| Note | Day Code (1 Day = 10 Hours) | Hour Code (Less than 10 Hours) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sick** | `S` followed by the number of hours (for example, `S10`) | `S` followed by the number of hours (for example, `S2`) |
| **Permission** | `I` followed by the number of hours (for example, `I10`) | `I` followed by the number of hours (for example, `I3`) |
| **Alpha (No Explanation)** | `A` followed by the number of hours (for example, `A10`) | `A` followed by the number of hours (for example, `A4`) |

**Writing Example:**

### Total Absence Calculation

The number of absence hours will be converted into decimal units in the **TOTAL ABSENT** column with the following conversion (Assuming 1 school day = 10 lesson hours):
- 1 hour = 0.1
- 2 hours = 0.2
- ...
- 10 hours (1 day) = 1

### Action Buttons

Above the table, there are several action buttons to manage reports:
- **Recalculate**: Click the red **Recalculate** button to re-process attendance data and update values in the TOTAL ABSENT and POINT NOTE columns after you make attendance data changes in the table.
- **Export Data**: There are buttons to download reports into files (usually PDF or Excel).
