The **Special Activity Attendance** feature in eSchool makes it easy for teachers or class operators to record daily student attendance efficiently. A list-based view complete with attendance type choice buttons makes this process faster, more structured, and accurate.

### 🛠️ How to Use the Add Attendance Feature

#### 1. **Select Class and Date**

* Use the **class** dropdown (for example: `X METRO A`) to select the group.
* Specify the attendance date in the calendar column, for example `29-07-2025`.

***

#### 2. **Automatic Student List Appears**

After the class and date are selected, the system will display all students in that group with columns:

* **Sequence Number**
* **Full Name**
* **Registration Number**
* **Attendance Type** (Radio Button: Present, Sick, Permission, Alpha)

***

#### 3. **Filling in Individual Attendance**

Each student row has **four status options**:

* 🟢 **Present**
* 🔵 **Sick**
* 🟣 **Permission**
* 🔴 **Alpha**

Click one of the radio buttons according to the student's condition that day.

### 🧩 Bulk Edit Feature: Select Status en Masse

🔻 **[KEY FEATURE FOR TIME SAVING]**

If many students have the same attendance status, for example the whole class is present, you don't need to click one by one. Use the **bulk selection** feature at the bottom of the list:

➡️ Click the radio button according to the status you want to apply to all students:

* Example: Click ⭕ **Present** at the bottom, then all students will automatically be marked as "Present".

> 💡 You can still change the status for specific students after applying the bulk edit.

***

#### 4. **Save Attendance**

After finishing marking the attendance status of all students:

* Click the red **"Save"** button at the bottom right.
