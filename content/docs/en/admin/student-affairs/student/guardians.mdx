- The system will reset the password and the guardian can log in again with the default set by the system (usually announced by the school).

### Important Notes

- Ensure guardian emails are not duplicate (unique) to avoid account conflicts.
- If one guardian has more than one child, the system automatically connects them through the same account.
- Data changes here will immediately impact the display on the guardian portal.

### Practical Tips

- Use full guardian naming to avoid confusion.
- Always ensure Mobile No and Email are active so that important information from the school can be received.
- It is recommended to upload guardian photos for visual identification purposes in the school system.
