The Student Data Import feature is designed to facilitate the mass entry of student data into the eSchool SIAKAD Plus system. With this feature, admins don't need to input one by one through manual forms, just use a specifically formatted CSV file.

---

### How to Access

1. Open **Student Affairs** > **Student** > **Import Data**.
2. Click the **Sample File** button to download the CSV template.
3. Fill in the file according to the provided format.
4. Upload the file using the **Upload** button.
5. Click **Save** to process the data into the system.

### Required CSV File Format

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only files with the `.csv` (Comma Separated Values) extension can be used for the import process.

The uploaded file must meet the determined structure, cannot be in Excel (`.xlsx`), `.ods`, or other formats.

### CSV Format Structure

The following are the column structures that must be present in the `.csv` file:

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `first_name` | Student's first name. |
| `last_name` | Student's last name (can be left blank if none). |
| `mobile` | Student's active mobile number. |
| `gender` | Gender, can only contain `male` or `female`. |
| `dob` | Date of birth in `dd-mm-yyyy` format. |
| `admission_date` | Admission date, format: `dd-mm-yyyy`. |

### Tips for Successful Import
