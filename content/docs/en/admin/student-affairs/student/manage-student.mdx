- Example: "X RPL 1" or "XI TKJ 2".

### 📌 Important Notes

- All entries marked with * (required) must be filled so that data can be saved and validated by the system.
- Email and mobile number are crucial, ensure there are no writing errors.
- If the guardian does not have an email, you can create a new email first so that validation runs successfully.
- Although the guardian photo is optional, it is highly recommended for more complete documentation.
