- Admin can check the **Reset Password** option in this form.
- The system will reset the password and the parent can log in again with the default set by the system (usually announced by the school).

### Important Notes

- Ensure parent email is not duplicate (unique) to avoid account conflicts.
- If one parent has more than one child, the system will automatically connect them through the same account.
- Data changes here will directly impact the display in the parent portal.

### Practical Tips

- Use complete parent naming to avoid confusion.
- Always ensure Phone Number and Email are active so important information from the school can be received.
- It is recommended to upload parent photo for visual identification purposes in the school system.
