The Reset Password feature is used to help students who have forgotten their account password. When a student selects the "Forgot Password" option during login, their reset request will automatically enter this page so that school admins/operators can follow up.

---

### How This Feature Works

1. **Student forgets password** → Clicks "Forgot Password" during login.
2. The system automatically records the request and displays it in the **Student Affairs** > **Reset Password** menu.
3. Admins/operators will see a list of students who have submitted reset requests.

### Reset Password Page View

Each entry contains:

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **No** | Sequence number of the reset request entry. |
| **Name** | Student's full name. |
| **Registration No** | Student ID for unique identification. |
| **Action** | ✏️ icon to process the reset. |

### Steps to Reset Password

1. Click the ✏️ (Edit) icon on the student row you want to help.
2. The system will display a reset form where you can reset the student's password manually or automatically.
3. Once saved, students can log in using the new password.

### Important Notes

- Not all students will appear on this page. Only those who click the "Forgot Password" button are recorded.
- If a student does not appear in the list, ensure they have actually submitted a request through the login page.
- Once the password is reset, it is recommended that students immediately change it back for account security.

---

### Operational Tips

- For efficiency, check student data before resetting to avoid wrong accounts.
- Use a secure password management system to prevent leaks.
- If students experience technical difficulties when logging in, ensure their accounts are already active in the correct academic year and class.
