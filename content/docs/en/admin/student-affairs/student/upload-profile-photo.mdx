### Technical Notes

- Recommended file size is maximum **500KB** so as not to overburden the system.
- File format must be an image (not PDF or document).
- The system will automatically link the image to the student or guardian account based on class and data ID.

### When to Use?

- Compiling digital or physical student cards.
- For re-data collection or updating student & guardian identities.
- When there are data changes or update requests from parents.
