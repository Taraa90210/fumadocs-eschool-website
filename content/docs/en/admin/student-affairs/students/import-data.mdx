The Import Student Data feature is designed to facilitate the mass entry process of student data into the eSchool SIAKAD Plus system. With this feature, admins don't need to input one by one through manual forms, just use a specially formatted CSV file.

2. Click the **Sample File** button to download the CSV template.
3. Fill in the file according to the given format.
4. Upload the file using the **Upload** button.
5. Click **Save** to process data into the system.

### Required CSV File Format

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only files with `.csv` (Comma Separated Values) extension can be used for the import process.

The uploaded file must meet the predetermined structure, cannot be in Excel (`.xlsx`), `.ods`, or other formats.

### CSV Format Structure

The following is the column structure that must be in the `.csv` file:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `first_name` | Student's first name. |
| `last_name` | Student's last name (can be left blank if none). |
| `mobile` | Student's active phone number. |
| `gender` | Gender, can only contain `male` or `female`. |
| `dob` | Date of birth in `dd-mm-yyyy` format. |
| `admission_date` | Admission date, format: `dd-mm-yyyy`. |

### Successful Import Tips

- Don't change column names in the CSV file.
- Use spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or LibreOffice to edit CSV files.
