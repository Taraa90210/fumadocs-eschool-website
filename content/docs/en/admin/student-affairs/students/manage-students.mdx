### Steps to Fill Out Add Student Form

#### 1. Registration Number (Automatically filled)
- The system will automatically generate a unique Registration Number, such as example: `2025/2026070169`.
- No need to change.

#### 2. Class (Required)
- Select the student's class/learning group from the available dropdown.
- Example: "X RPL 1" or "XI TKJ 2".

#### 3. Academic Year (Required)
- Determine the active academic year where the student will be entered, for example: `2025/2026`.
- This option is already available in the dropdown.

#### 4. Admission Date (Required)
- Fill in the official date the student was accepted.
- Format: `DD-MM-YYYY`, example: `28-07-2025`.

#### 5. Status (Must be Selected)
There are two options:
- **Active**: Student immediately enters the active system and affects the subscription cycle.
- **Inactive**: Student will not be counted as an active user.

> [!WARNING]
> The red note below this column provides a warning regarding activation implications.

#### 6. First Name & Last Name
Fill in the student's full name by dividing it into two columns:

If the student only has one name, fill in the "First Name" column and leave "Last Name" empty.

### 📌 Important Notes

- All fields marked with * (required) must be filled in so that data can be saved and validated by the system.
- Email and phone number are very crucial, make sure there are no typos.
- If the guardian does not have an email, you can create a new email first so that validation runs successfully.
- Guardian photo, although optional, is highly recommended for more complete documentation.
