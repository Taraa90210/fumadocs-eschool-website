The Additional Form feature is provided to adjust school administrative needs that are not available by default in the eSchool system. Each school may have a unique format or type of data that needs to be filled in by students during registration, data updates, or other processes.

With this feature, schools can add special data columns such as **Blood Type**, **Medical History**, **Kindergarten Origin**, etc. that are not available by default in the system.

### Adding New Forms

The Add Form section is located at the top of the page. Use this form to add new entries to the form list.

| **Name** | Name of the column/form to be added. |
| **Type** | Type of input used (Text, Number, Date, etc). |
| **Required** | Activate toggle if this column must be filled in by students. |

#### Steps to Add:

1. Fill in the form name (example: "Blood Type").
2. Select the input type, for example Text.
3. If the form must be filled in by students, activate the **Required** option.
4. Click **Save** to add the form to the list.

### Form List

After the form is saved, data will appear in the **Form List** table below.

This table contains information:

- **Name**: Input column name.
- **Type**: Input type (Text, Dropdown, etc).
- **Required**: Displays the status of whether this input is required or not.
- **Action**: Actions that can be taken on each form.

### Action Icon Features (⋮)

In each form row there is a three-dot icon (⋮) that provides two important functions:

- **Edit**: Change the name, input type, or required status of the form.
- **Delete**: Remove the form from the list (soft delete).

Deleted forms can be displayed again by clicking the **Deleted** link in the upper right of the table.

### Usage Tips

- Use clear and unambiguous form names.
- Don't use forms for data that is already available in the system (such as NISN, NIK, etc), except for backup duplication purposes.
- Validate required forms regularly so as not to complicate the student data input process.
- Avoid too many forms so as not to confuse students when filling them out.
