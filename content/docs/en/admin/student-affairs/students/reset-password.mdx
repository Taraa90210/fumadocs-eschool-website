The Reset Password feature is used to help students who forget their account password. When students select the "Forgot Password" option when logging in, their reset request will automatically enter this page, so that admin/school operators can follow up.

---

### How This Feature Works

1. **Student forgets password** → Click "Forgot Password" when logging in.
2. The system automatically records the request and displays it in the **Student Affairs** > **Reset Password** menu.
3. Admin/operator will see a list of students who have submitted reset requests.

### Reset Password Page Display

Each entry contains:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **No** | Reset request entry sequence number. |
| **Name** | Student's full name. |
| **Registration No** | Student ID for unique identification. |
| **Action** | ✏️ icon to process reset. |

### Steps to Reset Password

1. Click the ✏️ (Edit) icon on the row of the student you want to help.
2. The system will display a reset form where you can reset the student's password manually or automatically.
3. After saving, students can login using the new password.

### Important Notes

- Not all students will appear on this page. Only those who click the "Forgot Password" button are recorded.
- If students do not appear in the list, make sure they actually submitted a request through the login page.
- After the password is reset, it is recommended that students change it again immediately for account security.

### Operational Tips

- For efficiency, check student data before resetting to avoid wrong accounts.
- Use a secure password management system to prevent leaks.
- If students experience technical difficulties when logging in, make sure their account is active in the correct academic year and class.
