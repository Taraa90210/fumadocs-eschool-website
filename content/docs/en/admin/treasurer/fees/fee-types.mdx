The **Fee Types** page is used to manage all types of fees applied in the school, such as routine fees, exams, construction, and other optional fees. Through this page, users can add, edit, deactivate, or delete fee data as needed.

### 1. Basic Information

The **Basic Information** section is used to add or change fee details.\
Available fields include:

* **Fee Type:** Determines the type of fee, for example *routine (monthly)*, *one-time payment*, or *optional*.
* **Fee Name:** Name of the fee to be billed, for example “School Cleanliness Contribution” or “Exam Fee”.
* **Class:** Determines which classes are charged the fee. Users can select one or several classes at once.
* **Amount (Rp):** Nominal fee that must be paid.
* **Description:** Additional description explaining the purpose or details of the fee.

### 2. Payment Schedule

The **Payment Schedule** section functions to determine the billing period and due date.\
Available fields:

* **Start Billing:** Initial date of billing start.
* **End Billing:** Last date of billing for recurring fee types.
* **Due Date:** Payment due date.
* **Fine (%):** Percentage of fine that will be applied if payment passes the due date.

After all data is filled, click **Save** to save the new fee type or updates to existing data.\
The **Reset** button can be used to clear all inputs and start filling from scratch.

The table can be filtered based on fee type and has a search feature to facilitate finding specific data.

### 4. Actions on Fee Data

Each row in the table has an **Action** button on the right side that functions to manage fee status:

* If the fee is **active**, users can choose to **Edit** or **Deactivate**.
* If the fee is **inactive**, the action button changes to **Activate** or **Delete Permanently**.\
  This feature makes it easy for users to manage the life cycle of fee data without having to delete important data directly.
