### 1. Add Special Fee

The Add Special Fee section consists of two main areas: **Student Info & Fee Type** and **Amount Details**.

#### a. Student Info & Fee Type
- **Student**: Select the name of the student who will be charged a special fee.
- **Fee Type**: Select the type of fee already registered in the system (for example "Building Fee", "Qurban Contribution", etc.).

Both of these columns are mandatory before proceeding with filling in the fee amount.

#### b. Amount Details
- **Initial Amount (Rp)**: The initial value of the fee that is automatically filled based on the selected fee type.
- **Discount Amount (Rp)**: Nominal deduction or fee relief, if any.
- **Final Amount (Rp)**: The final value of the fee after the deduction, calculated automatically by the system.
- **Note**: Optional column to add additional notes such as the reason for granting a discount or other administrative information.

After all data is filled, click **Save** to save the special fee, or use the **Reset** button to clear all entries and start from the beginning.
