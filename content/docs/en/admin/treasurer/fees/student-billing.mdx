The **Special Fees - Student Billing** page is used to monitor all student bills in detail based on academic year, level, class, fee type, and payment status. Through this page, admins can view a list of students along with their billing nominal details and settlement status.

* **Academic Year:** Determines the academic year to be displayed.
* **Level:** Filters data based on class level (e.g., X, XI, XII).
* **Class:** Displays data according to a specific class.
* **Fee Name:** Filters based on fee types such as “SPP”, “Building Fee”, and so on.
* **Payment Status:** Choosing between all statuses, such as *Unpaid*, *Partial*, *Paid*, or *Inactive*.

In addition, a **Search** column is available at the top right of the table to search for students directly by name or NISN.
