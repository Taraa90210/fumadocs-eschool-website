The **Finance Dashboard** page displays a summary of the school's overall financial condition in a single view. The goal is to help users understand the flow of income, expenses, and current financial status without having to open reports one by one.

### 1. Financial Summary

At the top of the page, there are four main boxes displaying summary data:

* **Total Income:** Shows the total amount of all school receipts in the selected period.
* **Total Expenses:** Shows the total amount of all school expenses in that period.
* **Profit/Loss:** Displays the difference between total income and total expenses. A negative value means a loss occurred.
* **Pending Payments:** Shows the total nominal amount of payments not yet completed by related parties, along with the number of pending transactions.

This section can also be filtered by **month** and **academic year** to facilitate specific data analysis.

### 2. Income & Expense Graph

A line graph displays the comparison between **total income** and **total expenses** per month in one academic year. This graph makes it easy for users to see school financial trends, such as months with the highest expenses or lowest income.

### 3. Expense Categories

This section displays a pie chart that divides expenses based on categories such as:

* Salaries
* QHS Activities
* Maintenance
* Exam Activities
* Library\
  The goal is so that users can know the proportional allocation of school funds.

### 4. Teacher Salary

There are two main components:

* **Payment Status Graph:** Shows the number of teachers with "Paid" and "Pending" payment status.
* **Teacher Salary Table:** Displays the total number of teachers and salary nominals based on payment status.

This section helps the finance department monitor teacher salary payments that are still pending.

### 5. Student Fee Discount

Displays a list of students who received fee cuts along with details:

* Student name
* Class
* Final amount after discount

Also accompanied by a summary:

* **Total Student Discounts:** Number of students receiving discounts.
* **Total Discount Amount:** Total nominal value of discounts given.
* **Average Discount:** Average discount value per student.
* **Total Final Amount:** Total amount of fees after discounts are applied.

### 6. Student Billing

This table contains a list of fee types charged to students, including:

* Fee type (such as cleanliness, textbook, contribution, and enrollment fee)
* Payment due date
* Number of students charged the fee
* Total billing nominal

The search feature in the top right of the table helps find specific billing data quickly.
