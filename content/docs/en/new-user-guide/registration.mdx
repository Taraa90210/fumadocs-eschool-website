## **How to Register and Subscribe to eSchool**

The eSchool application can only be used by schools that have officially subscribed through the eSchool team. The account registration process is carried out by the eSchool admin team, not by schools or users directly.

### **Registration Steps:**

1. Schools register on the eSchool Siakad website page by clicking the "Register Your School" button.

3. After activation, the eSchool admin will:
   * Create a school admin account (for principal/operator).
   * Provide initial login access.

4. School admins can then create and manage other user accounts such as:
   * Teachers
   * Students
   * Parents/guardians

5. User accounts will be sent via email or official communication media from the school.

### **Important**

* Registration cannot be done independently by individuals (teachers/students/parents).
* The entire process starts from the school's official request to eSchool.
* If you are an individual who wants to use eSchool, please direct your school to contact us.
