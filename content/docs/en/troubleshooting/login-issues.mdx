#### 📌 Common Causes of Login Failure to the eSchool SIAKAD Plus Website

eSchool Web **does not support self-registration**. All user accounts (admin, teacher, student, parent) **can only be created by the school** through the formal management system.

Common reasons for login failure:

* Account has not been created by the school admin
* Incorrect login data (email/username/password mismatch)
* School is not officially registered in the eSchool system
* Access is restricted by the school admin

#### 🏫 How to Gain Access to eSchool Web

1. **School Registration**\
   Schools must first register officially via the page:\
   🔗 Register Your School
2. **Verification & Activation by the eSchool Team**\
   After verification, the primary school admin account will be created and sent via official email.
3. **Account Distribution by School Admin**\
   The school admin will create and distribute accounts for:
   * Teachers
   * Students
   * Parents/Guardians
4. **Login to eSchool Web**\
   After receiving the account, users can log in directly via:\
   🔗 eSchool Web Login

#### 🔐 Important to Know

* ❌ There is no **"Create Account"** or **"Sign Up"** button on the login page
* ✅ Accounts can only be created and managed by officially registered school admins
* 👤 Individuals (teachers/students/parents) are not allowed to create accounts without going through the school
